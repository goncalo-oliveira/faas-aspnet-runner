# OpenFaaS ASPNET Function Runner

Function runner used by the ASPNET Functions template since v2.0.

> NOTICE: I've stopped using OpenFaaS and as such, I'm no longer maintaining this project. I've moved all my workloads to [Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/) and [JustFaaS](https://github.com/justfaas/justfaas), which don't require the usage of templates.
